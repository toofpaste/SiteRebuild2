# SiteRebuild

#### By _Michael Larragueta_

## Description

 _This website is reddit with a slightly different look. I added the sidebar on the right when you click the hamburger menu and a cleaner looking post feed. You can sort by 7 different combinations and you can also view the posts 6/14/19_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repo from github https://github.com/toofpaste/SiteRebuild2_
* _run "npm install"_
* _run "ng serve"_
* _go to http://localhost:4200 in your browser_

## Specs
_This website saves a username, upvote count, title, link, thumbnail, time since upload, and subreddit name into an object for every single post. You can sort by best/hot/new/rising/controversial/top posts and there is a link to the wiki. Your username and karma for your account is in the upper left. Search subreddit, buy reddit gold, submit a new post, or create your own subreddit from the slide out side bar on the right_


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.
